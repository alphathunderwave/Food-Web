# Team Meeting 7

### Date and Time: 03/26/18 (3:00 -4:00 pm)


### Attendance: 
Everyone present.

### Brief Summary:

YELP changed usage of its API. So now we are navigating the site using YELP's own search function. Need to confirm with Dr. Hartloff
about it. Thinking on changing the scope of our project on not using the YELP API. Rather than making a search for restaurants we 
are planning on building a site where users will be able to sell home made foods. Our particular focus in this case will be immigrants 
who are illiterate in English and other people who want to be self sufficient by selling food.
